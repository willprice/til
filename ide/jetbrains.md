## Made a bunch of changes and broken tests and can't Ctrl-Z you're way back, use local history
(2016-02-12)

Local history records changes across the repository along with test run results,
it's very easy to open up the local history browser and get back to your last
working version of code.

*VCS -> Local History -> Show Local History*
